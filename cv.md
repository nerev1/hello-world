## 3. Summary
I just want to become a web developer. I did not have much front-end or back-end experience, but after i had a bit of self-education 
I liked it a lot. I already have a job, but i am trying to get new knowledge during my free time. 
  I had remote education at IBA lab for core Java language but i signed up too late (start of the 5th year of education) and did not
have a time to finish the whole course. Also I had some questions with military service (already don't). For now i just want to get new
knowledges and get a job to get real development experience. I would really like to learn more about back-end development
and different modern technologies.
## 4. From university i got basic knowledge about html, css, sql, c++, delphi. Also I learned core java a bit.
## 5. I lost my Java and university tasks with my old broken laptop.
## 6. There was some Java tasks (basic core Java features, JUnit tests etc) on my old laptop but it's already broken for 2 years.
## 7. Education:
    * Francisk Skorina Gomel State University (2011-2016).
    * Unfinished core Java course in IBA lab.
    * HTML academy. (Almost all tasks of elementary level. Used [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) if got some troubles).
    * Codecademy. HTML, CSS basics.
    * Reading some 'Oracle' documentation and a Java book.
## 8. Finished the whole duolingo course, can read some simple texts and some kinds of basic IT documentation with rare google translate using. When I studied basic HTML, searched almost every tag on MDN (english ver) and got some new info about them.
